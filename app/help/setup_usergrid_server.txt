Description:
    The Rumm Usergrid plugin is designed to quickly and easily spin up a backend server for a mobile app.
    The `install usergrind on server :id` command sets up a node with everything you need to run Apigee's
    Usergrid service. Then organization, user, application and objects can be setup through the command-line
    tool. Apigee also provides SDKs for many popular platforms, including Android and iOS, that talk to the
    Usergrid service.


Examples:
    rumm setup usergrid server sorrel-shantung
